This project exists essentially to make part of my individual commute easier.

On the way to UC Berkeley several times a week for class I like getting a 
coffee drink at the Peet's on the station platform level at Embarcadero station,
where all the baristas know my name and know that all I really want from life is
a large pumpkin spice latte with whole milk and as much whip as they can spare. 

Before creating this program I would waste countless minutes each morning trying
to coordinate my MUNI and BART apps in my head to see whether, upon arriving at
Embarcadero Station from the N line inbound, I would have time to get a drink 
before the BART train to Downtown Berkeley arrived.

The intended functionality of this app is that as I step off the MUNI train and 
onto the escalator, I can open up this webpage (probably from a cute shortcut on
my phone's homepage) and see exactly the answers I need with 100% less stress:

1. When is the next train leaving?
2. Do I have time for a drink?
3. If so, which drink(s)?

Added FUNctionality (emphasis on the fun) can be found in calculating the number
of calories I'm wasting on my PSL, and eventually in seeing the relative
nutritional values of all the drink possibilities I list as available. Once I 
get around to doing that it will be great practice with javascript objects!

I gleaned my data from readily available webpages on peets.com and by using the 
developer-friendly BART API at api.bart.gov.

Everything about this project should be taken with a large grain of sass.  For 
questions and comments email kdelgardo@berkeley.edu.
